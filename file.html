<h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>

<p><strong>1. Fluid Grid: </strong>All layout elements are sized in relative units such as percentages, instead of absolute units such as pixels.</p>
<p><strong>2. Flexible Images: </strong>Are also sized in relative units</p>
<p><strong>3. Media Queries: </strong>Allow us to specify different CSS style rules for different browser widths.</p>
